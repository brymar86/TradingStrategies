# TradingStrategies
Upload work with Trading Strategies, Bactesting Classes, and Data ingestion scripts for automated Trading. 

### Purpose

Simply to take interesting strategies and express them in OOP python format or clean funcitonal programming.  In addition I've built my own backtestor and am also experimenting with backtesting.py.  

Trend Strategies, market neutral strategies, and mean-reversion strategies in both equities and crypto will be uploaded.  Eventually I will include derivative strategies by early 2024.
