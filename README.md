# TradingStrategies
I enjoy caputuring ideas in code.  I will update this repositroy with new scripts on various strategies that I find interesting and potentially useful. 

### Purpose

Simply to take interesting strategies and express them in OOP python format or clean funcitonal programming.  In addition I've built my own backtestor and am also experimenting with backtesting.py.  

Trend Strategies, market neutral strategies, and mean-reversion strategies in both equities and crypto are my areas of interest.  Eventually I will include derivative strategies by early 2024.   Please contact me with any questions at bryanmarty86@gmail.com

PS

This code is meant for educational purposes only and is my way of expressing my thoughts.
